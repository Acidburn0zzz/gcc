This is GCC with the patches from CodeSourcery and Sun Microsystems used in
the gcc 3.4.3 shipped with Solaris on the codesourcery/* and sun/* branches,
and the GCCFSS sources from the git repository in their source tarball in the
sun/gccfss* branches.

The il-* branches contain the Solaris patches rebased forward across GCC
versions in an attempt to bring them up to date.  All stupidity in the merges is
mine.
